      "3-pass upscale by default (480p->720p->1080p)",
      "Use context options during upscaling at low denoise",

  "summary": "A comprehensive multi-pass video upscaling workflow that combines AnimateDiff techniques with modern upscaling models to achieve high-quality 480p to 1080p upscaling on 16GB VRAM. The workflow features face detailing, VACE integration for better consistency, and various optimizations for memory efficiency, though it requires significant RAM and processing time."
