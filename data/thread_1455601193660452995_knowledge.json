    "recommended_settings": [
      "Higher resolution (1024x1024) improves lip sync significantly vs 512x512",
      "Steps: 6/2 for HuMo motion (changed from 7/3)",
      "97 frames per extension = ~3.68 seconds at 25fps",
      "Audio delay: 0.2s default (adjustable for sync)",

    "tips": [
      "Prompt aggressively for motion in SVI stages",
      "Remove 'speaking/talking' from prompts - let HuMo add when needed",
      "Try different seeds if lip sync breaks on specific segments",

    "Uses SVI 2 Pro lora combined with SVI v2 lora for 2.1",
    "HuMo processes audio by splitting vocals from instruments using melbandroformer",
    "Audio encoder uses same overlap as video but should be padded with silence",
    "VRAM usage increases with frames per generation and resolution, not number of extensions",
    "Each segment runs independently - if first works, all should work",

      "issue": "Static images in extensions with certain SVI models",

      "issue": "RAM OOM crashes during long generations",

  "summary": "This is a sophisticated workflow combining Wan2.2 and HuMo models with SVI loras to create high-quality lip-synced video extensions. The v5 iteration offers improved motion dynamics and color consistency, with extensive community testing showing successful results up to 40+ seconds with proper settings and prompting."
