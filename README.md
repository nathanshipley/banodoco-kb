# Banodoco Knowledge Base

**Status: Work in Progress**

This project aims to transform the [Banodoco Discord](https://discord.gg/banodoco) into a searchable knowledge base for the open source AI community.

## What's Here Now

Currently just a [data exploration page](https://nathanshipley.github.io/banodoco-kb/) summarizing what's in the database:

- **1M+ Discord messages** spanning Aug 2023 - present
- **6,600+ community members**
- **227 channels** covering video generation, image generation, training, ComfyUI, and more
- **460+ AI-generated daily summaries** with technical details and contributor attribution

## The Vision

The Banodoco Discord is one of the most active communities for open source AI video/image generation. Years of technical discussions, troubleshooting, and discoveries are buried in chat history. This project aims to surface that knowledge in a more accessible format.

Topics covered include:
- **Video models:** Wan, LTX, HunyuanVideo, CogVideoX, AnimateDiff, Mochi
- **Image models:** FLUX, SDXL, Chroma, SD3
- **Training:** LoRA training, fine-tuning, dataset preparation
- **Tools:** ComfyUI workflows, custom nodes, optimization techniques
